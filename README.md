### We learned....
  - Game development methodology and procedures
  - Most of the development of our game pertained to tasks that were necessary in Project 1 (i.e. model placement and aesthetic design)
  - More about the Hydrologic Cycle than we thought there was

### Tools Used
  - [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) :video_game:
  - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) :crystal_ball:
  - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) :headphones:
  
### Biggest issues
  - Learning to use Unity and C# without having any prior experience.
  - Integration of the project as a whole
  
### Grade Requirements
 - [x] Have water as the central element of your project

### Key features
  - The purpose of our game was to teach our players about the Hydrologic Cycle (also known as the Water Cycle). Level 1 of the game serves as a lesson to teach the basic concepts of the Hydrologic Cycle and level 2 gives the player a chance to apply what they learned and visualize the cycle as it happens under their control.
