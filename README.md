### We learned....
  - Game development methodology and procedures
  - Most of the development of our game pertained to tasks that were necessary in Project 1 (i.e. model placement and aesthetic design)
  - More about the Hydrologic Cycle than we thought there was

### Tools Used
  - [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) :video_game:
  - [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) :crystal_ball:
  - [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) :headphones:
  
### Biggest issues
  - Learning to use Unity and C# without having any prior experience.
  - Integration of the project as a whole
  - Maintaining portability (i.e. not including any extra dependencies for the final build of the game to run)
  
### Grade Requirements
 - [x] Have water as the central element of your project

### Key features
  - The purpose of our game was to teach our players about the Hydrologic Cycle (also known as the Water Cycle). Level 1 of the game serves as a lesson to teach the basic concepts of the Hydrologic Cycle and level 2 gives the player a chance to apply what they learned and visualize the cycle as it happens under their control.

#### Menu
  - At the menu the player can select which level they would like to start on, view controls, the leaderboard (currently a work in progress) and game options(also a work in progress)

#### Level 1
  - On level 1, the player is required to pilot a boat to the land mass holding the classroom. Once reaching the inside of the class room the player will be given the option of starting a conversation with the teacher model within. The teacher will then give the student a lesson on the water cycle. Once the player has completed the lesson, they will be able to go back on the boat and pilot the boat to level 2.
  - Chat-like dialogue system
  - Animated model
  - Working aquatic vehicle

#### Level 2 description goes here
  - In level 2, the player will begin on a terrain that will give them 3 options for what body of water they would like to trigger the water cycle on. Once they've walked into a teleporter and reached the part of the scene that houses the selected body of water, the player will be required to find a sphere, skinned to look like the sun. Once finding the sphere, the player will *scroll up* on the mouse wheel and use the *q* and *e* keys to control the temperature of the orb. As soon as the orb is active and has reached the correct temperature, the water in the scene wil begin to evaporate, a cloud will form, and it will begin to rain. A timer is used to keep track of how long it takes the player to complete the level.

### Planned timeline
  - We used a Trello board to track the progress and development of the project! :clipboard:
